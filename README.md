# Roster
This repository contains program written for cs50 pset7. 

The import program takes in the information stored a csv input file that contains student's first, middle (if any), last name, house, and birth year into a database. 

The roster program can print out a quick summary of students' informations (names and birth years) in a given house.

Examples are included in a csv file containing fictional Hogwarts students.
