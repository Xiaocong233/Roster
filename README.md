## Description
This repository contains program written for cs50 pset7. 

The import program takes in the information stored a csv input file that contains student's first, middle (if any), last name, house, and birth year into a database. 

The roster program can print out a quick summary of students' informations (names and birth years) in a given house.

Examples are included in a csv file containing fictional Hogwarts students.

## Usage
```
//to import csv file into SQL database
$ python import.py filename

//to print out organized student roster in a specific house
$ python roster.py house
```

## What I learned
* Better familiarization with SQL syntax
* Using SQL in Python to more automate the process of importation and exportation of data
